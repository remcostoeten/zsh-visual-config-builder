# Rate Limiting Service

A flexible and secure rate limiting implementation for Next.js applications, designed to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated requests with browser fingerprinting.

## Features

- 🔒 **Login Protection**: Prevents brute force attempts with configurable attempt limits
- ⏱️ **Cooldown Actions**: Support for one-time actions with cooldown periods (e.g., likes, votes)
- 🔍 **Browser Fingerprinting**: Prevents circumvention through browser/cookie clearing
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Built-in timer component with adaptive time display
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Easy to adjust limits and durations through constants
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive monitoring of rate limit events
- 🗺️ **Geolocation**: Track and visualize rate limit events on a map
- 🤖 **Bot Detection**: Automated attempt detection with scoring system

## Usage Examples

### 1. Login Rate Limiting

```typescript
import { RateLimitService } from '@/services/rate-limit-service';

const rateLimit = new RateLimitService();

// Check if login attempt is allowed
const { allowed, waitTime } = await rateLimit.checkLoginAttempt(
  'user-123',
  'user@example.com'
);

if (!allowed) {
  console.log(`Too many attempts. Please wait ${waitTime}ms`);
  return;
}

// Proceed with login...
```

### 2. One-Time Actions (e.g., Like Button)

```typescript
const handleLike = async () => {
  const { allowed, waitTime } = await rateLimit.checkActionLimit(
    'post-456',
    'user-123',
    'user@example.com'
  );
  
  if (!allowed) {
    // Show cooldown timer
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with like action...
};
```

### 3. Using the Timer Component

```tsx
import { RateLimitTimer } from '@/features/rate-limit/components/rate-limit-timer';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <RateLimitTimer
      waitTimeMs={30000} // 30 seconds
      onComplete={() => {
        // Handle timer completion
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Configuration

Rate limits are configured in `src/features/rate-limit/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const RATE_LIMIT = {
  LOGIN: {
    MAX_ATTEMPTS: 5,      // Maximum attempts allowed
    WINDOW_MINUTES: 15,   // Time window for attempts
    LOCKOUT_MINUTES: 30,  // Lockout duration after max attempts
  },
  LIKE_ACTION: {
    COOLDOWN_DAYS: 7,     // Cooldown period for like actions
  },
};
```

## Admin Monitoring

The service includes a comprehensive admin dashboard at `/admin/rate-limits` that provides:

1. **Real-time Overview**
   - Active rate limits
   - Automated attempt detection
   - Total events tracked

2. **Detailed Event Information**
   - Timestamp and duration
   - User information (if available)
   - Device and browser details
   - Geographic location with map visualization
   - Automation score and analysis

3. **Security Features**
   - IP-based access control
   - Detailed event logging
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Geographic tracking

### Setting Up Admin Access

Configure admin access in your environment variables:

```env
# Comma-separated list of admin IP addresses
ADMIN_IPS=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1
```

The admin dashboard requires:
1. A valid IP address from the `ADMIN_IPS` list
2. A valid authenticated session

## Security Considerations

1. **Browser Fingerprinting**
   - Uses multiple factors to generate a unique identifier:
   - User agent
   - Screen resolution
   - Timezone
   - Prevents simple circumvention through cookie clearing

2. **Event Logging**
   - Comprehensive event tracking
   - IP address logging
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Geographic location
   - Behavioral patterns

3. **Automation Detection**
   - Scores attempts based on patterns
   - Tracks time between attempts
   - Analyzes session behavior
   - Flags suspicious activity

4. **Limitations**
   - Client-side implementation can be circumvented
   - Best used with server-side rate limiting
   - Consider IP-based rate limiting for critical endpoints

## Timer Component Features

The `RateLimitTimer` component provides:

- Automatic time formatting (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- Smooth countdown animation
- Accessibility support
- Customizable styling through className prop
- Completion callback functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Login Protection**
   - Use in combination with server-side rate limiting
   - Monitor repeated attempts
   - Implement progressive delays
   - Log suspicious patterns

2. **Action Limiting**
   - Use for non-critical features
   - Implement user feedback
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Track geographic distribution

3. **Error Handling**
   - Clear feedback about wait times
   - Show remaining attempts
   - User-friendly time formats
   - Explain lockout reasons

## Demo

A live demo is available at `/demo/rate-limit` showcasing:
- Login attempt limiting
- Like action cooldowns
- Timer component
- Reset functionality

## Implementation Details

The rate limiting service uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Browser APIs for fingerprinting
- Local storage for persistence
- React hooks for state management
- Leaflet for map visualization
- IP-API for geolocation
- UA Parser for device detection

## Contributing

When extending the rate limiting service:
1. Add new limits to the `RATE_LIMIT` constant
2. Add corresponding storage keys to `STORAGE_KEYS`
3. Implement new methods in `RateLimitService`
4. Update event logging in `RateLimitEventService`
5. Add monitoring to the admin dashboard
6. Update documentation
